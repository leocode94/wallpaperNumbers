# wallpaperNumbers

This piece of code written in Python renames files on a directory based on their extensions.

I used the Python programming language to write the code.

I've always wanted to rename my wallpapers assigning random numbers to each one of them within a certain range, as a way to keep everything organized.

In order to use the program:
- Open the file
- Edit the location of your folder on the "directory" variable
- Type the extensions you want to manipulate in the "if" statements
- Edit the final message.
